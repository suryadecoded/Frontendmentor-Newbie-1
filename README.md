# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

My solution for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK)four card feature section challenge. I have not used anty tools in this challenge. It was purely based on my judgement. I only had access to the images in the design folder. The appropriate dimensions and spacings for all elements on the page were a result of multiple trials and errors.
